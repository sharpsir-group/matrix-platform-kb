## AI Features

### HumaticAI Integration

- **NBPS (Next Best Prompt Suggestions)** — the AI suggests reply options that the broker can choose from or edit.
- **Bot toggle** — each conversation has a bot on/off switch. When "on", the AI handles replies. When "off", only human agents reply.

### How to Use AI Suggestions

1. Open a conversation.
2. If AI suggestions are available, they appear above the message input.
3. Click a suggestion to use it as your reply (you can edit before sending).
4. To disable AI for a conversation, toggle the bot switch off.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**Q: What is Matrix Comms?**
A: It is the Sharp Matrix app for WhatsApp Business communication. It lets you chat with clients, run campaigns, and manage contacts through WhatsApp.

**Q: How is this different from regular WhatsApp?**
A: Matrix Comms uses the WhatsApp Business API via Twilio. It supports multiple agents sharing one business number, templates, campaigns, analytics, and AI-assisted replies — features not available in regular WhatsApp.

**Q: Can clients see which broker they are chatting with?**
A: No. All messages appear to come from the company WhatsApp Business number. The client sees one conversation with the company.

### Messaging

**Q: Why can't I send a free-text first message to a new contact?**
A: WhatsApp Business policy requires that the first outbound message uses an approved template. After the client replies, you can send free-text messages within a 24-hour window.

**Q: What is the 24-hour messaging window?**
A: After a client sends a message, you have 24 hours to reply with free-text messages. After 24 hours, you must use a template to re-engage the conversation.

**Q: My template was rejected. What do I do?**
A: Review WhatsApp's template guidelines (no spam, no prohibited content). Edit the template to comply and resubmit. Common rejection reasons: too promotional, unclear opt-out, or violating WhatsApp commerce policies.

**Q: Can I send images or documents?**
A: Yes. Use the attachment feature in the chat window to send images, PDFs, and other supported file types.

### Conversations

**Q: How do I know if a conversation is assigned to me?**
A: Conversations assigned to you appear in your inbox. You can also check the Assignments page.

**Q: Can I see conversations assigned to other brokers?**
A: Only if your role has broader visibility (Admin, or team/global scope). Brokers typically see only their own conversations.

**Q: What are internal notes?**
A: Notes visible only to staff, not to the client. Use them to share context with colleagues about a conversation.

**Q: What are reminders?**
A: You can set a reminder on a conversation to follow up at a specific date and time. You will receive a notification when the reminder is due.

### Campaigns

**Q: How many messages can I send in a campaign?**
A: This depends on your Twilio account limits and WhatsApp Business tier. Check with your Admin for current limits.

**Q: Can I track if clients opened my campaign messages?**
A: You can see delivery and read receipts in the campaign analytics, subject to WhatsApp's privacy settings.

## Troubleshooting

### Login and Access

| Problem | Possible Cause | What to Do |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Cannot log in** | Wrong credentials or no account | Check email/password. Contact Admin if you don't have an account. |
| **"Access Denied" on a page** | Your role doesn't have permission | Contact your Admin to check your role and permissions. |
| **Session expired unexpectedly** | Token expired | Log in again. This is normal after periods of inactivity. |

### Messaging

| Problem | Possible Cause | What to Do |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Message not delivered** | Client's WhatsApp is inactive, or number is wrong | Verify the phone number. Check delivery status in the conversation. |
| **"Template required" error** | 24-hour window has expired | Send a template message to re-engage the conversation. |
| **Template variables not filling** | Mismatch between template and provided variables | Check that all required variables are filled correctly. |
| **Media fails to send** | File too large or unsupported format | WhatsApp supports images (JPEG, PNG), PDFs, and documents up to 16 MB. Reduce file size and try again. |
| **Messages appear delayed** | Network or Twilio processing delay | Wait a few minutes. If persistent, check the WebSocket status indicator in the header (green = connected, red = disconnected). |

### Real-Time Updates

| Problem | Possible Cause | What to Do |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Conversations not updating in real time** | WebSocket disconnected | Check the connection indicator in the header. The app falls back to polling every 5 seconds when disconnected. Refresh the page. |
| **New message notifications not appearing** | Browser notifications disabled or connection issue | Enable browser notifications in your browser settings. Refresh the page. |

### AI and Bot

| Problem | Possible Cause | What to Do |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **AI suggestions not appearing** | Bot is disabled for this conversation, or HumaticAI service is down | Check the bot toggle. If it's on and suggestions still don't appear, try refreshing. Report to Admin if persistent. |
| **AI gave an incorrect reply** | AI misunderstood the context | Toggle the bot off for this conversation and reply manually. Report the incorrect reply to your Admin for AI training feedback. |

### Campaigns

| Problem | Possible Cause | What to Do |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Campaign not sending** | Template not approved, or contact list is empty | Verify the template is approved. Check that contacts have valid phone numbers. |
| **Low delivery rate** | Invalid numbers or clients opted out | Review your contact list for invalid numbers. Check opt-out status. |

---

## Known Issues and Workarounds

| Issue | Workaround | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Country flag images may not load for some phone number prefixes | Does not affect functionality — the flag is a visual indicator only | Cosmetic |
| When WebSocket is disconnected, new messages appear with up to 5-second delay | The app automatically polls every 5 seconds as a fallback. Refresh the page to re-establish the live connection. | By design |
| Role configuration endpoint may return empty on first load | Refresh the page. If the issue persists, the Admin should verify role configurations in Settings. | Known |
| API error details may not show unless "Show Detailed Errors" is enabled | Ask your Admin to enable detailed errors in Settings → API for troubleshooting. | Configuration |
