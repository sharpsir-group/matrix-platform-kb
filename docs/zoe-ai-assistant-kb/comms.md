## AI Features

### HumaticAI Integration

Matrix Comms integrates with HumaticAI for:

- **Autonomous first responses** — the AI can automatically reply to incoming messages when the bot is turned on for a conversation and the AI service has been set up by your Admin.
- **NBPS (Next Best Prompt Suggestions)** — the AI suggests reply options that the broker can choose from or edit.
- **Bot toggle** — each conversation has a bot on/off switch. When "on", the AI handles replies. When "off", only human agents reply.

### How to Use AI Suggestions

1. Open a conversation.
2. If AI suggestions are available, they appear above the message input.
3. Click a suggestion to use it as your reply (you can edit before sending).
4. To disable AI for a conversation, toggle the bot switch off.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**Q: What is Matrix Comms?**
A: It is the Sharp Matrix app for WhatsApp Business communication. It lets you chat with clients, run campaigns, and manage contacts through WhatsApp.

**Q: How is this different from regular WhatsApp?**
A: Matrix Communications connects to WhatsApp through a business messaging service. It lets multiple team members share one company WhatsApp number, use pre-approved templates, run campaigns, see analytics, and get AI-assisted replies — features not available in regular WhatsApp.

**Q: Can clients see which broker they are chatting with?**
A: No. All messages appear to come from the company WhatsApp Business number. The client sees one conversation with the company.

### Messaging

**Q: Do I need to use a template for the first message?**
A: WhatsApp Business policy generally requires that the first outbound message uses an approved template. The app allows you to start conversations, but Twilio/WhatsApp may reject non-template first messages. Use a template when initiating contact with a new number.

**Q: What is the 24-hour messaging window?**
A: After a client sends a message, you have 24 hours to reply with free-text messages. After 24 hours, you must use a template to re-engage the conversation.

**Q: My template was rejected. What do I do?**
A: Review WhatsApp's template guidelines (no spam, no prohibited content). Edit the template to comply and resubmit. Common rejection reasons: too promotional, unclear opt-out, or violating WhatsApp commerce policies.

**Q: Can I send images or documents?**
A: Yes. Use the attachment feature in the chat window to send images, PDFs, and other supported file types.

### Conversations

**Q: How do I know if a conversation is assigned to me?**
A: Conversations assigned to you appear in your inbox. You can also check the Assignments page.

**Q: Can I see conversations assigned to other brokers?**
A: Only if your role has broader visibility (Admin, or team/global scope). Brokers typically see only their own conversations.

**Q: What are internal notes?**
A: Notes visible only to staff, not to the client. Use them to share context with colleagues about a conversation.

**Q: What are reminders?**
A: You can set a reminder on a conversation to follow up at a specific date and time. You will receive a notification when the reminder is due.

### Campaigns

**Q: How many messages can I send in a campaign?**
A: This depends on your Twilio account limits and WhatsApp Business tier. Check with your Admin for current limits.

**Q: Can I track if clients opened my campaign messages?**
A: You can see delivery and read receipts in the campaign analytics, subject to WhatsApp's privacy settings.

### Messaging

| Problem | Possible Cause | What to Do |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Message not delivered** | Client's WhatsApp is inactive, or number is wrong | Verify the phone number. Check delivery status in the conversation. |
| **"Template required" error** | 24-hour window has expired | Send a template message to re-engage the conversation. |
| **Template variables not filling** | Mismatch between template and provided variables | Check that all required variables are filled correctly. |
| **Media fails to send** | File too large or unsupported format | WhatsApp supports images (JPEG, PNG), PDFs, and documents up to 16 MB. Reduce file size and try again. |

### AI and Bot

| Problem | Possible Cause | What to Do |

| **AI gave an incorrect reply** | AI misunderstood the context | Toggle the bot off for this conversation and reply manually. Report the incorrect reply to your Admin for AI training feedback. |

### Campaigns

| Problem | Possible Cause | What to Do |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Campaign not sending** | Template not approved, or contact list is empty | Verify the template is approved. Check that contacts have valid phone numbers. |
