## Cross-App Troubleshooting

### Issues That Affect All Apps

| Problem | Possible Cause | What to Do |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Cannot log in to any app** | SSO system is down, or credentials issue | Try again in a few minutes. If widespread, IT is likely already investigating. Contact IT. |
| **All apps are slow** | Server performance issue or network problem | Check your internet speed. Try a different browser. If all colleagues have the same issue, report to IT. |

| **Error messages in a language I don't understand** | Browser language setting | Check the app's language setting (if available in sidebar/settings). |

### Browser Issues

| Problem | What to Do |
|---------|------------|
| **Pages look broken or misaligned** | Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete). Try a private/incognito window. |
