## What Is ITSM?

ITSM is the IT service and asset management app for Sharp Sotheby's International Realty. It provides a service desk where you can submit and track IT requests (like "my laptop is broken" or "I need new software"). It also includes a list of all company IT equipment (called CMDB), and tools for managing vendors, projects, budgets, and IT documentation. All employees can submit requests; IT staff handle everything else.

## Zoe Can Help You Submit IT Requests

You don't need to figure out ITSM alone. Zoe (the AI assistant) can help you create a well-structured IT request:

### How It Works
1. **Tell Zoe your problem.** For example: "My laptop screen is flickering" or "I need access to Matrix FM."
2. **Zoe suggests the right request type:**
   - Something broken? → **Incident**
   - Need something new? → **Service Request**
   - Planned IT change? → **Change Request**
   - Recurring issue? → **Problem**
3. **Zoe suggests a priority:**
   - Total outage for many users → **Urgent**
   - Can't do your job, no workaround → **High**
   - Inconvenient but can work around it → **Medium**
   - Minor or cosmetic → **Low**
4. **Zoe reminds you what to include:** app name, error message, screenshot, and which asset is affected.
5. **Zoe directs you to ITSM:** Go to My Requests → New Request, fill in the form, and submit.

### Common Requests Zoe Can Help You Draft

| Your situation | Service Type | Priority | Example title |
|---------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| App shows blank page | Incident | High | "Meeting Hub loads blank page after login" |
| Need a new laptop | Service Request | Medium | "Request new laptop for new hire Maria P." |
| Software license needed | Service Request | Medium | "Need Adobe Acrobat Pro license for contracts" |
| Email not working | Incident | High | "Outlook emails not syncing in Matrix Pipeline" |
| Printer broken | Incident | Medium | "Office printer on 3rd floor not printing" |
| Request VPN access | Service Request | Low | "VPN access for remote work" |
| Recurring app crash | Problem | Medium | "Client Connect crashes weekly during bulk export" |
| Server upgrade planned | Change Request | Low | "Upgrade staging server to latest OS" |

---

## Use Cases: When Do I Use ITSM?

### For All Employees

**Use Case 1: "An app is not working"**
You open Meeting Hub and see a blank page or an error message.
1. Try refreshing the page. If that does not help, press Ctrl+Shift+Delete, select "Cached images and files", and click Clear.
2. If the problem persists, ask Zoe for help.
3. If Zoe can't fix it, go to ITSM → My Requests → New Request.
4. Title: "Meeting Hub shows blank page after login"
5. Description: Explain what you see, what browser you use, and attach a screenshot.
6. Service Type: Incident. Priority: High (if you can't work).
7. Related Asset: Select your laptop or the relevant system.

**Use Case 2: "I need new equipment or software"**
You need a new monitor or a software license.
1. Go to ITSM → My Requests → New Request.
2. Title: "Request second monitor for desk 4B"
3. Service Type: Service Request. Priority: Low or Medium.
4. Description: Explain why you need it and any specifications.

**Use Case 3: "I can't access an app or page"**
You see "Access Denied" or "Page Not Available."
1. First, check with your Admin — it may be a permissions issue.
2. If it's a technical error (not permissions), submit an ITSM request.
3. Service Type: Incident. Include the exact URL and error message.

### For IT Staff

**Use Case 4: "Managing the ticket queue"**
1. Start your day by opening SD Queue and sorting by priority (Urgent first).
2. Assign unassigned tickets to team members based on expertise.
3. Update ticket status as you work: Open → In Progress → Resolved → Closed.
4. Use comments to document your troubleshooting steps — this helps if the ticket is escalated.

**Use Case 5: "Tracking software license compliance"**
1. Go to Software Assets to see all licenses.
2. Check "Purchased" vs "Allocated" seat counts.
3. Set up alerts for expiring licenses (check the sidebar badge).
4. When an employee leaves, deallocate their seats promptly.

## Best Practices for IT Requests

### For Requesters (All Employees)
- **Be specific in your title** — "Email not working" is too vague. Try "Outlook not syncing in Matrix Pipeline since Monday."
- **Always include**: what you were doing, what happened, what you expected, and a screenshot.
- **Select the right service type** — Incidents are for broken things. Service Requests are for new things.
- **Choose priority honestly** — Urgent is for outages affecting many people. Don't mark a cosmetic issue as Urgent.
- **Select a related asset** — this is required. If unsure, describe the device in your description and IT will fix the link.
- **Check before submitting** — search My Requests to see if you already have an open ticket for the same issue.

### For IT Staff
- **Respond to Urgent tickets within minutes** — acknowledge receipt even if you can't resolve immediately.
- **Document everything in comments** — future tickets for the same asset will benefit from your notes.
- **Link tickets to assets** — this builds a history for each asset that helps with replacement decisions.
- **Use the analytics dashboard** — track response times and identify recurring problems that need deeper investigation.
