# Qobrix CRM Data Model — Reference & Migration Source

> Source: `qobrix/qobrix_openapi.yaml` (OpenAPI 3.0, API version 2.0)
> Documentation: https://qobrix.com/real-estate-crm/advanced-tools/rest-api/
>
> **Role in Sharp Matrix**: Qobrix is the **current CRM** used by Sharp Sotheby's International Realty.
> It is a **reference source** for understanding what data and capabilities the platform must support,
> and a **migration source** for existing data. It is NOT the system of record for the Sharp Matrix Platform —
> RESO DD 2.0 is the canonical data layer. See [reso-dd-overview.md](reso-dd-overview.md).

## Overview

Qobrix is the CRM currently used by Sharp Sotheby's International Realty. The Sharp Matrix Platform will replicate and extend Qobrix's capabilities through purpose-built apps (Broker App, Manager App, etc.), all sharing the RESO DD canonical data layer. The Qobrix API documentation serves as a reference for what the platform must support. The API is RESTful (JSON), uses UUID identifiers, and supports search expressions, pagination, and resource expansion.

## Migration Mapping to RESO

| Qobrix Entity | RESO Resource (canonical) | Migration Notes |
|---------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Property | Property | Direct mapping for most fields; see [property-field-mapping.md](property-field-mapping.md) |
| Contact | Contacts | first_name→ContactFirstName, last_name→ContactLastName, etc. |
| Agent / User | Member | Agent profiles map to Member resource |
| Groups | Teams | Team structures |
| Opportunity | HistoryTransactional | Deal/pipeline data; RESO doesn't have a direct "Opportunity" equivalent |
| Property Viewing | ShowingAppointment | Viewing records |
| Task | — | No direct RESO equivalent; platform extension needed |
| Contract | — | No direct RESO equivalent; platform extension needed |
| Offer | — | No direct RESO equivalent; platform extension needed |
| Media | Media | Photo/video/document records |
| Project | — | Development projects; platform extension needed |

## Authentication

- API key-based: `X-Api-User` + `X-Api-Key` headers
- OAuth 2.0: Authorization code flow with access/refresh tokens
- Session-based: Login endpoint returns session token
