# Lead Qualification: MQL → SQL

> From raw lead to qualified opportunity with clear criteria and documented disqualification

## Lead Qualification Path

```
RAW LEAD → MQL (Marketing Qualified Lead) → SQL (Sales Qualified Lead) → Active Pipeline
                                                    ↓ (fails BANT)
                                              Nurturing Pool (if timeline >12 months)
                                                    ↓ (disqualified)
                                              Reject (with documented reason → marketing feedback)
```

## Stage 3: SQL (Sales Qualified Lead)

## Disqualification Reasons (Must Be Documented)

| Reason | Marketing Feedback |
|--------|-------------------|
| No budget | Adjust targeting for income/budget level |
| Wrong location | Refine geographic targeting |
| Unrealistic timeline | Adjust messaging for different buying stages |
| Not decision-maker | Target decision-makers in campaigns |
| No real interest (window shopping) | Tighten qualification forms |
| Competitor already engaged | Monitor competitive landscape |

## Reverse Connection: Marketing ↔ Sales

When a broker disqualifies a lead, they must document the reason. This information feeds back to marketing for:
- Optimizing lead source quality
- Improving targeting parameters
- Adjusting campaign messaging
- Reducing cost per qualified lead
