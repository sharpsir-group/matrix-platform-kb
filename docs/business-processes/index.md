## Key Process Rules

1. **Two parallel pipelines** run simultaneously: seller-side (listings) and buyer-side (sales)
2. **Matching is continuous**: every new listing triggers buyer matching; every new buyer triggers listing matching
3. **First meeting/showing** is the trigger that moves a lead from follow-up (nurturing) to active sales
4. **Long-term leads** (>12 months timeline) go to nurturing pool, not active forecast
5. **Every disqualification** must have a documented reason fed back to marketing
