# Follow-up vs Active Sales: The Boundary

> Two distinct processes in one system with a clear trigger for transition

## The Two Processes

| Attribute | FOLLOW-UP (Nurturing) | ACTIVE SALES |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Purpose** | Prepare the deal — warm the lead | Close the deal — drive to signing |
| **Stages** | Qualification, Deep Research, pre-first-meeting | Solution/Viewing, Decision Making, Deal Closing |
| **Cadence** | Weekly / monthly | Daily |
| **Management rhythm** | Weekly review | Daily standup |
| **Focus** | Maintain contact, progress the lead | Close deals, negotiate terms |
| **Key metrics** | Touch count, response rate, missed follow-ups | Conversion to deal, time to close, commission size |

## The Trigger

┌─────────────────────┐         FIRST MEETING / SHOWING         ┌──────────────────────┐
│   FOLLOW-UP         │ ──────────────────────────────────────→  │   ACTIVE SALES       │
│   (Nurturing)       │                                          │   (Deal Management)  │
│                     │     This is the moment of transition     │                      │
│   Before the first  │     from Follow-up to Active Sales.     │   After the first    │
│   meeting/showing   │     From this point, the client          │   meeting/showing    │
│                     │     requires daily attention and         │                      │
│                     │     active deal management.              │                      │
└─────────────────────┘                                          └──────────────────────┘
```

**The first personal meeting or property showing** is the trigger that transitions a lead from the nurturing process into the active sales process. Before this moment, it's preparation. After this moment, it's execution.

## Follow-up Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Zero tolerance | Not a single follow-up may be missed or forgotten |
| Auto-scheduling | After every contact, system proposes next follow-up date and time |
| Priority order | Missed (critical) → Today → Hot potentials → Tomorrow → New leads |
| Content suggestions | AI suggests themes: new listings matching criteria, market updates, personal recommendations |
| Engagement tracking | System tracks opens, clicks, reactions and adjusts priorities accordingly |

## Active Sales Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Daily cadence | Every active deal gets daily attention |
| Stage discipline | Every deal has exactly one active stage at any time |
| Artifact tracking | Each stage transition requires documented artifacts |
| Forecast accuracy | Only deals in active pipeline count toward revenue forecast |
| Long-term exclusion | Leads with timeline >12 months stay in nurturing, not active forecast |

## Dashboard Implications

### Broker Dashboard (Daily View)
1. **New Leads** — requiring first contact (within 24 hours)
2. **Follow-up Today** — scheduled for today
3. **Missed Follow-ups** — critical, immediate action needed
4. **Follow-up Tomorrow** — preparation for tomorrow's contacts
5. **Hot Potentials** — ready for appointment
6. **Pipeline Value** — active deals total

### Manager View
- Weekly review: Target vs Actual on revenue & forecast, listing status
- Daily standup: Missed follow-ups (overdue), new leads, hot potentials, critical actions
