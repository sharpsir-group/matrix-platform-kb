## How to Use This Knowledge Base

**For Lovable (building Matrix Apps):**
1. Read `platform/app-template.md` — the template patterns you must follow
2. Determine if your app is CDL-Connected or Domain-Specific
3. If CDL-Connected: read `data-models/dash-data-model.md` for practical field names
4. Read the relevant `business-processes/` doc for workflow logic
5. Use Dash-derived field names for all CDL table columns (RESO names for syndication only)
6. Follow the dual-Supabase, SSO, RLS patterns from the template
7. For security model details: see `/home/bitnami/matrix-platform-foundation/SECURITY_MODEL.md`

**For general context:**
1. Start with `AGENTS.md` (repository root) for quick navigation
2. Read Chapter 0 (Platform) to understand the three-platform architecture
3. Read Chapter 1 (Vision) for strategic context
4. Navigate to the specific chapter relevant to your task
