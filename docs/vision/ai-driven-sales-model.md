## Model Overview

The model unifies traditional sales processes with AI technologies for maximum broker effectiveness. Core principle: **the broker works with the client; the system works with the process**.

### 4 Elements of the Model

| # | Element | Purpose | Key Metrics |
|---|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Commission Funnel** | Revenue engine — tracks revenue from plan to close | Revenue (actual vs plan), # closed deals, avg commission check, cycle length, MQL→Closed Won conversion |
| 2 | **Listings** | Seller-side — inventory management & syndication | Active listings, new listings/period, Days on Market, listing→sale conversion, matching quality |
| 3 | **Appointments** | Truth point — first meeting triggers Active Sales | Meeting→deal conversion, no-show rate, days from showing to deal, # appointments/month |
| 4 | **Follow-ups** | Nurturing engine — zero follow-ups may be missed | Missed follow-ups (must be 0), response rate, avg response time, follow-up→appointment conversion |

### 2 Representations of the Process

| View | User | What They See |
|------|------|---------------|
| **Kanban Board** (for managers) | Sales Manager | Seller-side pipeline (listings), Buyer-side pipeline (buyers), matching control, revenue forecast, broker performance |
| **AI Brokerage Copilot** (for brokers) | Broker | Client card with Next Best Action, matching suggestions, stage-aware recommendations, automated routine tasks |

## Element 1: Commission Funnel

The primary goal of the entire sales management system.

### Goals
- **Maximize revenue**: Increase closed deals count and average commission check
- **Predictability**: Accurate pipeline forecasting based on conversion rates
- **Steady growth**: Stable month-over-month and quarter-over-quarter increases

### Forecast Rule
Long-term leads (timeline >12 months) do NOT pollute the active sales forecast. They move to a separate **nurturing pool** with monthly cadence, preserving forecast accuracy and team focus on "hot" deals.

### Key Metrics
- Revenue (actual vs plan)
- Number of Closed Won deals
- Average commission check
- Sales cycle length (days)
- Conversion: MQL → Closed Won

---

## Element 2: Listings (Seller-Side)

Listings = the seller-side process. This element forms the inventory for the buyer-side.

### Seller-Side Kanban Stages

| Stage | Tasks | Artifacts |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1. PROSPECT | Find potential sellers, first contact, present services | Contact info, initial property assessment |
| 2. CONTACTED | Detailed market consultation, demonstrate expertise and case studies | Service presentation, comparative market analysis |
| 3. AGREEMENT SIGNED | Prepare listing, professional photoshoot, legal review | Signed agreement, listing with photos and description |
| 4. ACTIVE LISTING | Organize showings, collect buyer feedback, adjust strategy | Showing reports, buyer feedback, change history |
| 5. SOLD | Negotiate final price, coordinate with lawyers, close deal | Signed purchase contract, payment confirmation |
| 6. AGENT COMMISSION PAYMENT | Complete work documentation, confirm payment receipt, calculate and transfer commission | Completed work act, commission payment confirmation |
| 7. CLOSED WON | Final deal closure, archive documents, record success | Full document package, final report |
| 8. LISTING WITHDRAWN | Remove property from sale per seller initiative, document reason | Reason (changed mind, sold independently, unsatisfied with service), reactivation possibility |

### Bi-Directional Matching

| Direction | How It Works |
|-----------|-------------|
| Listing → Matching Buyers | AI automatically finds clients from the database whose criteria match the new listing |
| Buyer → Matching Listings | AI generates a Curated List based on buyer's specific needs |

### Listing Integrations
- **Syndicate Dashboard**: Automated syndication to all key real estate portals
- **MLS Systems**: Integration with Multiple Listing Services for maximum reach
- **Social Media**: Auto-publish on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn with optimized content
- **Corporate Website**: Real-time sync with company website
- **PDF Brochures**: Auto-generation of professional property presentations
- **Email Campaigns**: Automated distribution of new listings to matching clients
- **Calendar of Showings**: Integration with calendar for viewing planning

### Listing Quality Metrics
- Days on Market (DOM)
- View → Showing conversion
- Showing → Offer conversion
- Number of active listings
- Listing → Sale conversion

---

## Element 3: Appointments

Appointments (meetings and showings) are the **truth point** where the broker directly interacts with the client and influences the purchase decision. The first meeting = the trigger for transitioning from Follow-up into Active Sales.

### Goals
- **Maximize meetings**: Increase quality appointments with qualified clients
- **High conversion**: Turn maximum meetings into closed deals
- **Effective time**: Optimize showing routes and meeting preparation

### Anatomy of an Appointment
1. **Preparation**: Study the client, select properties, plan route
2. **Questions list**: Pre-prepared questions to identify needs
3. **Fixed feedback**: Detailed notes on client reaction to each property
4. **Next step (follow-up)**: Concrete action and date for next contact

### Key Metrics
- Appointment → deal conversion
- No-show rate (missed meetings)
- Average days from showing to deal
- Appointments count per period
- Days with showings per month

---

## Element 4: Follow-ups

Follow-up = sales preparation (nurturing). Without it, there will be no closing. Missed follow-ups are the primary source of lost deals — the system must prevent every miss.

### Goals
- **Zero missed**: Not a single follow-up should be missed or forgotten
- **Timeliness**: Contact the client at the right moment with the right message
- **Lead progress**: Gradually move the client from cold to hot status

### How AI Copilot Helps with Follow-ups

### Key Metrics

- Response rate
- Average broker response time
- Follow-up → appointment conversion
- Touches before meeting
