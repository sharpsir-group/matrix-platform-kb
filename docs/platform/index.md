# Chapter 0: Sharp Matrix Platform — Overview

> The Sharp Matrix Platform is the target digital ecosystem for Sharp Sotheby's International Realty.
> It connects all business applications through a common data layer with Dash/Anywhere.com as the practical data model.
>
> **For Lovable**: To build apps, start with [app-template.md](app-template.md).

## What is Sharp Matrix?

Sharp Matrix is a **multi-app platform** where every application — from broker tools to client portals to AI engines — shares a single, consistent data layer. Dash/Anywhere.com provides the practical field definitions used for app development; RESO DD 2.0 serves as the interoperability standard for syndication and external APIs. Apps are built by **Lovable** using the `matrix-apps-template` starter kit and run on **Supabase**.

### Core Principle

> **Dash/Anywhere.com is the practical data core.** CDL-Connected apps use Dash-derived field names (e.g., `list_price`, `bedrooms`, `city`). RESO DD names are used for outbound syndication and the RESO Web API.

## Three-Platform Architecture

| Platform | Role | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| **Supabase** | Common Data Layer — system of record for apps | Edge Functions, Realtime, Auth, RLS, Lovable integration |
| **Databricks** | DWH & ETL engine — data ingestion and analytics | Medallion architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold), CDC, SQL analytics |
| **Lovable** | App builder — builds all Matrix Apps | Rapid development, native Supabase integration |

**Why Supabase over Databricks for CDL?** Databricks (with Lakebase) is a strong DWH but lacks Edge Functions and has no Lovable integration. Supabase provides the app-facing data layer with built-in auth, realtime, and edge compute.

## Two Types of Matrix Apps

| Type | CDL Usage | Live | In Progress | Planned |
|------|-----------|------|-------------|---------|
| **CDL-Connected** | Reads/writes shared RESO tables (`property`, `member`, `contacts`) | Agency Portal, Client Connect, Meeting Hub, Matrix Comms, Website CMS | Matrix Pipeline, Contact Mgmt, Integration Mgmt | Broker App, Manager App, Client Portal, Marketing App |
| **Domain-Specific** | Uses CDL only for auth/permissions; has own Supabase instance | SSO Console | HRMS, Matrix FM, ITSM, Notification Mgmt | Admin Console, BI Dashboard |

Both types share the same template patterns: dual-Supabase, SSO auth, permissions, RLS, shadcn/ui.
See [app-template.md](app-template.md) for full technical details.

## Reference Sources

| Source | Role in Sharp Matrix | Location |
|--------|---------------------|----------|
| **Dash / Anywhere.com** | **Practical core** — concrete field definitions for app development | `dash/BlankForm_*.docx`, Dash API |
| **RESO DD 2.0** | Interop standard — names for syndication and external APIs | `reso dd/RESO_Data_Dictionary_2.0.xlsx` |
| **Qobrix CRM** | Legacy migration source — being decommissioned | `qobrix/qobrix_openapi.yaml` |

## Phased Migration

### Current → Target

| Aspect | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| CRM | Qobrix | Matrix Apps on Supabase |
| Data direction (Dash) | Pull from Dash API/FILE | Push to Dash for syndication |
| System of record | Qobrix + Dash | Supabase CDL |
| Data warehouse | Databricks (ETL + DWH) | Databricks (analytics/BI only) |
| App builder | N/A | Lovable |

**Strategic goal**: Matrix Apps replace Qobrix CRM. Dash flips from pull to push. Supabase CDL becomes the sole system of record.

## How Apps Share Data

CDL-Connected apps operate on the same RESO-named Supabase tables:

1. **Client Connect** registers a contact → stored in RESO `contacts` table
2. **Meeting Hub** records an appointment → linked to the same contact
3. **Matrix Comms** sends a WhatsApp message → conversation attached to the same contact
4. **Matrix Pipeline** (in progress) manages leads, deals, contacts → CDL `property`, `contacts` tables + own `opportunities`, `leads` tables
5. **Agency Portal** aggregates stats → reads from all CDL tables
6. **AI Web Assistant** captures leads from website → routes to CDL contacts
7. **BI Dashboard** (planned) reports KPIs → aggregates from Databricks (synced from CDL)

Domain-Specific apps use their own Supabase instances but share auth, permissions, and UI framework through the SSO instance:
- **HRMS** (`wltuhltnwhudgkkdsvsr`) — employee records, vacations, onboarding, performance, documents
- **Matrix FM** (`retujkznogwplfrbniet`) — financial reporting, budgeting, planning, CORE allocation
- **ITSM** (`irjrcskfcyierdbefrpk`) — IT service desk, assets, software licenses, vendors, projects
- **Notification Management** (in progress) — centralized notification engine for all apps
