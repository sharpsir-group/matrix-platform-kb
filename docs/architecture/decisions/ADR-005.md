# ADR-005: Why RESO DD 2.0 as interop layer with Dash as practical core

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The CDL needed a data model for listings, contacts, and related entities. RESO Data Dictionary (DD) 2.0 is the industry standard for MLS syndication, but it is verbose and not always aligned with what brokers use day-to-day. Dash (Anywhere.com) is the practical core used by many luxury brokerages.

Options: RESO-only, Dash-only, or a hybrid.

## Decision

Adopt a **three-layer model**:

1. **Dash (practical core)**: Primary field names used in apps and internal queries
2. **x_sm_* extensions**: Platform-specific fields (e.g., `x_sm_team_id`, `x_sm_syndication_status`)
3. **RESO DD 2.0 (interop)**: Standard names for syndication, API responses, and external consumers

CDL tables store both Dash and RESO-aligned columns where needed. Mapping logic translates between layers at API boundaries.

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Apps use familiar Dash field names — less training, fewer mistakes
- Syndication and RESO Web API use standard names for certification
- Platform extensions are clearly namespaced and documented
- No compromise on either internal usability or external compliance

**Negative**

- Cross-system field mapping adds complexity and maintenance
- Dual naming requires documentation and mapping tables
- New fields must be evaluated for both Dash and RESO alignment
