# ADR-003: Why Lovable as the app builder

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A small team (~5 engineers) must build and maintain 12 applications. Options evaluated:

- **Hand-code React**: Full control, highest effort
- **Retool/Appsmith**: Low-code, but limited customization and vendor lock-in
- **AI builder (Lovable)**: AI-generated React/Vite/TypeScript with Supabase integration

The team needed rapid delivery of CRUD-heavy apps (listings, contacts, dashboards) without sacrificing code quality or the ability to customize.

## Decision

Adopt **Lovable** as the primary app builder for Sharp Matrix applications. Use it for:

- Rapid UI generation from natural language prompts
- Native Supabase client integration
- Exportable codebase (React, Vite, TypeScript) for version control and customization

The platform knowledge base (`matrix-platform-kb`) is structured to be LLM-readable so Lovable (and other AI tools) can consume architecture, data models, and business processes.

## Consequences

**Positive**

- ~10x development speed for CRUD and form-heavy apps
- Code is exportable — no black-box runtime; teams can fork and extend
- Lovable understands Supabase patterns (RLS, auth, queries)
- KB as single source of truth improves consistency across AI-generated apps

**Negative**

- Vendor lock-in risk if Lovable pricing or features change
- Generated code may require cleanup for production (error handling, i18n)
- KB must be kept up-to-date and well-structured for LLM consumption
